<p>An employer may apply for the grant more than once, as long as they continue to meet the employer eligibility criteria in the guidelines and have been successful in previous participation.</p>

<p>As there is a limited budget for the grant, applications will be assessed on an individual basis and prior funding does not entitle an employer to future funding. Priority will be given to employers who have not received Canada-Ontario Job Grant funding in the past six months.</p>
