<p>Employers that wish to access the grant are responsible for identifying the particular skills gaps they wish to address, the types of training that would address those gaps, and the specific individuals they would like to see trained.</p>

<p>Employers must provide a cash contribution towards the cost of training. Some additional flexibility is available for small employers (i.e., employers with 50 or fewer employees can make up-to-half of their contribution through wages paid to the employee).</p>

<p>Employers accessing the grant also must commit to having a job for the individual upon training completion (i.e., same or new for incumbent workers). For exceptional circumstances, this may involve entering into a job placement agreement with an unemployed individual that would commence during or after training.</p>
