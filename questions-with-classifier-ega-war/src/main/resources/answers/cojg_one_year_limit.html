<p>Training supported through the COJ grant focuses on occupation-specific skills that address more immediate gaps or needs identified by an employer. Therefore the grant applies a limit of one year maximum duration for funded trainings.</p>

<p>Other Employment Ontario training programs, such as Second Career, support multi-year, post-secondary education and advanced credential obtainment.</p>

<p>Offering training of up-to-one year in duration minimizes overlap with programs such as Second Career, and allows COJG resources to be directed towards addressing the immediate skills gaps identified by employers.</p>
