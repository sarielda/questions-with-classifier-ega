<p>As part of the Canada-Ontario Job Grant, the ministry has launched two, new, employer-driven skills training pilots:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Canada-Ontario Job Grant: Customized Training</b> pilot will assist in the development and delivery of firm-specific training solutions that meet employersâ€™ workforce development needs, where no such training exists.</li>
	<li><b>Canada-Ontario Job Grant: UpSkill</b> pilot will support employers in participating sectors meet their workforce development needs by providing employees with short-term technical and essential skills training aligned with the shared needs of the sector.</li>
</ul>
<p> For both types the training is intended for employed individuals acquiring new skills for their current job, or to prepare for another job with the same employer, and for unemployed individuals seeking a new job. The employer must have a job available at the end of the training for the individual being trained.</p>

<p>Training must not exceed one year in duration and must be provided by one of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Colleges of applied arts and technology</li>
	<li>Publicly-assisted universities</li>
	<li>School boards</li>
	<li>Private trainers operating in compliance with the Private Career Colleges Act, 2005</li>
	<li>Union-based training centres</li>
	<li>Product vendors.</li>
<ul>
